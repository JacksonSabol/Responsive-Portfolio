# Welcome!

### The following project is part 2 of 2 for Assignment 2 of the UCB Full Stack Coding Bootcamp



I employed HTML and CSS to make a responsive portfolio outlining myself and my professional development. The point of this exercise was to use media queries to establish breakpoints by screen resolution. I inserted breakpoints for those reading on a desktop computer (980px width), those on a tablet (768px width), and those on a smartphone (640px width). The snippet of CSS code below outlines how to establish these breakpoints for smartphone users inside of a div container:


```css

@media screen and (max-width: 640px) {
.container {
    width: 100%;
    max-width: 640px;
    margin: 0 auto;
    clear: both;
}
```

### Feel free to play around with the responsive elements by resizing your browser window.
